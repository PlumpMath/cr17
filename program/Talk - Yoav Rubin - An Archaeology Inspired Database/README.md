# "Designing a Database like an Archaeologist" - Yoav Rubin


**Format**:Talk, 40 minutes

**Topics**: Software design, databases, Datomic

500 Lines or less is the 4th book is the series The Architecture of Open Source Applications, in which each chapter presents a program solving a problem or describing a system, using at most 500 lines of code.

In the chapter "An Archaeology-Inspired Database"  I showed how to build an in-memory functional database (that follows the ideas in Datomic) which provides ACI and What-If transactions, graph and simple datalog queries, all using 360 lines of Clojure. I'll present the design, considerations and the implementation of the database, and talk about the key points I learned from this work.
