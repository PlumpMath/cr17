# "Putting It All Together" - Tom Coupland

**Format**: Talk, 40 minutes

**Topics**: Design, Event Sourcing, Spec, Yada, Kafka, Component

There are a myriad of Clojure libraries in the world, each providing a solution for one part or another of what it takes to create a fully fledged feature delivering system. There are also a great many combinations of these libraries working together as complete systems, providing value for business and user as like, but these complete systems can rarely be seen. The vast majority being developed behind closed doors, as is the norm in our industry. However, in this talk I'd like to show you something abnormal, a complete system that is not hidden, but being created completely in the open.

The [kixi.datastore](https://github.com/MastodonC/kixi.datastore) is a system that is being built by [MastodonC](http://www.mastodonc.com/) as open source software. Not nessarily for others to make direct use of, though you'd be more than welcome, but because we believe that open development contributes to the community as a whole. I would like to describe this system to you. After spending as little time as possible on the context of the system, I'll talk about the Event Sourcing style of the design, the libraries we use, and, most importantly, how we put it all together to create the system.

## About The Author

Tom Coupland is a Data Engineer at [MastodonC](http://www.mastodonc.com/). After subjective eons working with Java, through transaction processors, accounting systems, user collections, he was left exhaused and bewildered at his life choices. Then Clojure appeared and the scales fell from his eyes. Leading to wonderful years of highly concurrent programming, determining peoples musical tastes, recommundation engine creation and many other marvelous things.

Currently he can be found basking in the joy that is Clojure during the day, while keeping an eye out for other suitors in the evening. When not trying to make his bit of the software world a better place, he can be found out in the real one, running around, preferably in the mud, wind and rain.
