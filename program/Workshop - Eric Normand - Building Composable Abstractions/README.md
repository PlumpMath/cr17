# "Building Composable Abstractions" - \<Eric Normand\>


**Format**: *Workshop, 1 hour"*

**Topics**: *Functional programming and domain design*

At the 2016 Clojure/conj, I gave a presentation called
[*Building composable abstractions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20). I
laid out a process for developing abstractions that are free from
corner cases and compose well. This workshop is about helping you walk
through the process yourself. I'll be giving you a programming
assignment and you will break up into groups to develop it. I'll give
you time for each step of the process. At the end, each group will
quickly present what we have done.

## Prerequisites

Because the time is so limited, it is imperative that you watch 

* [Building composable abstractions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJIUoaIvD20)

I will assume that you have understood the process as I give it in the
video.

The more preparation you do, the more you will get out of your time
and expense of this workshop. As a bonus, if you'd like to get even
more out of it, I suggest *developing your own vector graphics system
using the process*. You can choose whatever metaphor you'd like.

Further, you can apply the process to something from your own life, be
it a problem at work or elsewhere.

## The Process

Just for reference, I will give the process here. One of the reasons I
gave the talk at the Conj was to start discussions, and that certainly
happened while I was still there. So this process is slightly
different from the one you see on the slide, but basically the same as
what I did on stage.

1. Elaborate a physical metaphor
2. Describe the meaning of your abstraction as mathematical statements
3. Construct the meaning using constructs from your programming language
4. Implement the abstraction by refactoring the meaning from Step 3.

## About The Author

Eric Normand is a long time functional programmer excited to see it
entering the mainstream. He loves teaching and cooking. You can learn
Functional Programming from him at
[PurelyFunctional.tv](https://purelyfunctional.tv/) and read his
thoughts in
[The PurelyFunctional.tv Newsletter](https://purelyfunctional.tv/newsletter). If
you visit him in New Orleans, you can meet his wife and
daughter. He'll even make you some gumbo if you tell him you're
coming.
