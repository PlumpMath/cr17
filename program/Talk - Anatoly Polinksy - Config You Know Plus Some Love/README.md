# Config You Know Plus Some Love - Anatoly Polinsky

**Format**: Talk, 40 minutes

### **Topics**

* Twelve factor [config methodology](https://12factor.net/config)
* [Consul](https://www.consul.io/): distributed configuration made easy
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/): software containerization
* [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/): a tool for managing secrets
* [cprop](https://github.com/tolitius/cprop)

### **Abstract**

The talk is about often "left for later" concern when creating things. It is about application configuration.
There is no unique way to do it right, but there definitely are concerns caused by environmental differences,
configuration data structures and security.

There is a well known [Config section](https://12factor.net/config) in twelve-factor methodology, but as I mentioned,
there is no unique way to "do it right", and I believe in Clojure, with rich data structures and ubiquitous reach of JVM libraries, we can do much better than that.
