# "Armature: building async data pipelines" - \<Your Name\>

**Format**: *Talk, 40 minutes"*

**Topics**: *core.async, data pipelines, sqs, queues, macros, production patterns*

Our systems are built on processes carrying state and their transitions can be
triggered by thousands of external (and internal) events. Managing them via
core.async with stateful channel management, no persistence, and limited
exception handling in a distributed environment can be cumbersome. In this talk,
I will share my experience on building core.async in production, and present a library
that aims to provide higher level abstractions for building robust data pipelines.

*TBD - 1-2 paragraphs describing the session and what attendees can hope to learn from it.*
