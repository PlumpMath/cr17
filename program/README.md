# Program & Schedule - CR17

Here you'll find an index of all the speakers and schedule details for Clojure Remote 2017.

As of right now (Dec. 6), you'll find *at least* the titles and speaker name
for each session. As speakers update their folders, you'll be able to get a
more detailed view of the talk, the speaker, and what you might get from
session.
