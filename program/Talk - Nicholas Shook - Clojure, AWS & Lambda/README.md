# "Serverless Clojure on AWS" - Nicholas Shook

**Format**: Talk, 40 Minutes

**Topics**: AWS infrastructure for running Serverless Clojure Lambda functions: Cloudformation, VPC, Security Groups, RDS, API Gateway, AWS Cognito, and Cloudwatch.

In college while studying rhetoric, I came across the epiphany that everything in this world is a trope. As it pertains to software development, specifically web development, patterns like load balancing, SSL, authentication, authorization, param sanitization, process monitoring and accessing a SQL database are omnipresent motiffs that nearly every developer has to tackle. With serverless architecture, cloud companies, like Amazon Web Services, have abstracted many of these problems so we as developers do not need to solve them anymore.

In this talk, I will go over how to set up a serverless architecture on AWS using Cloudformation, and how to leverage Clojure to write AWS Lambda. We will be creating a web application to host dinner parties to showcase how many of the tropes of web development can be handled by Amazon so you can focus on the narrowly tailored application logic that makes your system unique.
