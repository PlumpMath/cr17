# Tooling matters - Daniel Solano Gómez

**Format**: Talk, 40 minutes

**Topics**: Clojure, ClojureScript, tooling, 

Tooling matters.  Developer experience matters.

Great tooling makes our lives as developers better:  It helps us be more
productive and happier and can help us better understand the technologies we
work with.  Conversely, inadequate tooling frustrates our lives and creates
barriers for newcomers.

As Clojure approaches its tenth year, let us take a moment to review the state
of tooling in Clojure:

* Are we, as a language community, creating the right tools to make Clojure
  easy to learn and a delight to work with?
* What are the inherent strengths and weaknesses in Clojure with respect to
  tooling?
* What can we do to improve the tooling story in Clojure?

Join me in starting a conversation around these questions with the goal of
making the Clojure development experience better.
