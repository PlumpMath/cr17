# Keynote: The Value of Learning - Jay Martin

**Format**: Keynote, 60 minutes. 

**Topics**: *Learning, Teaching, Communication*

*This talk focuses a spotlight on the subject of learning. Just how much do we value learning itself as a subject worthy of careful study? I propose that Clojure's future success hinges on our collective response to this question.

My hope is that you'll walk away from this talk with a fresh awareness of the value of learning in your own life, in the Clojure community and in the world at large. You will be offered a specific new habit to employ in your weekly routine to elevate learning to its deserved rank, exponentiating your productivity, not only in your studies, but in every project you touch.*
