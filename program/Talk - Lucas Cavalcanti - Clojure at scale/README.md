# "Clojure at scale" - Lucas Cavalcanti


**Format**: *Talk, 40 minutes*

**Topics**: *Clojure, Datomic, Kafka, Schema, Hexagonal architecture, Design, Tests*

There are plenty of patterns and literature about how to organize systems in tranditional
languages like Java or C#. The same isn't exactly true for functional programming languages,
specially Clojure. At Nubank we had to figure it out over 3 years of writing tens of microservices
in Clojure, using some of our knowledge from other languages and some creativity.

Several patterns emerged, several mistakes were made and eventually we came up with a very
sustainable and scalable way to write new code even for developers which are new to Clojure.
This talk will explore those learnings.
