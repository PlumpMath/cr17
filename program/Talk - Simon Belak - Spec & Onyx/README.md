# Spec + Onyx: an experience report - Simon Belak

**Format**: Talk, 40 minutes

**Topics**: core.spec, Onyx, Kafka, ETL

Clojure has always been good at manipulating data. With the release of spec and [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx) (_“a masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, high performance distributed computation system”_) good became best. In this talk you will learn about a data layer architecture build around Kafka and Onyx that is self-describing, declarative, scalable and convenient to work with for the end user. The focus will be on the power and elegance of describing data and computation with data; and the inferences and automations that can be built on top of that.
