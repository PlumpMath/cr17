# ClojureRemote Chat - Matthew Ratzke
> _powered by Hoplon and Feathers.js_

**Format**: Tutorial/Walkthrough, 40 minutes

**Topics**: 
 - Boot
 - Hoplon
 - Javelin
 - Feathers.js
 - Structure of Applications

This will be a guided walkthrough of building a chat application using Hoplon/Javelin and Feathers.js.

The theme of this tutorial will be the Structure of Applications. I believe that many of the developers using ClojureScript are coming to the language from other JS languages. These languages do not share the same philosophies when it comes to the structure of applications. I highly recommend any ClojureScript developer watch the MIT Video Lectures on the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/).

Our chat application will look at the structure of applications using Hoplon, which allows you to design your client applications using abstractions over the DOM. These abstractions interact with Javelin cells and our Feathers.js client to provide reactive features and spreadsheet data-flow. Our Feathers.js server applications mirrors the structure of our client and provides in-memory data storage for services.

Conference attendees will learn how to:
 - Initialize a Hoplon/Feathers application using Boot
 - Build a Feathers.js client/server application using FeatherScript
 - Build a Hoplon/Javelin client application
