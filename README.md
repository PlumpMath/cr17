# Clojure Remote 2017

Welcome to the home of Clojure Remote 2017. This repository serves as the main source of truth for all of our speakers, talks,  source code and presentation notes.

Find us on the web at [clojureremote.com](https://clojureremote.com)

While this repository is spartan today (Dec. 5), we will be adding our existing and recently confirmed speakers here, then enlisting their help to populate this repository.

## Contributing

We are more than happy to consider pull-requests improving this repository, but we have a few guidelines you should be aware of:

- This is a *conference* repository, not an active software projects. We'll gladly accept PRs for bugs, typos or other small improvements. Large changes or additions should be discussed with the organizers or speaker, as they may or may not fit their vision of the conference/session.
- A speaker's talk folder is theirs. As organizers we are here to help facilitate a conversation, but at the end of the day it's a speaker's call what is in or out in their talk.

**New speakers should visit [program/TEMPLATE-README.md](program/TEMPLATE-README.md) for information on updating their program details.**
